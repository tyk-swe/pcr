# Changelog

All notable changes to PacketcraftR are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Eight implementation fuzz targets, property coverage for document, capture,
  filter, layout, reassembly, and TLS behavior, plus non-gating Criterion and
  peak-RSS measurement harnesses.
- `DocumentLimits` and `Packet::parse_with_limits`, enforcing matching bounded
  JSON/YAML semantics before retained values are allocated.

### Changed

- Updated all Rust dependencies and lockfiles, including Criterion 0.8,
  Noyalib 0.0.28, jsonschema 0.52, RustCrypto hashes 0.11, libloading 0.9, and
  pcap 2.5.
- **Breaking (library):** fuzz runs now take `fuzz::RunInput` instead of four
  positional arguments.
- **Breaking (library):** `replay::SystemAuthorizer::new` now receives the
  caller's `Arc<Registry>` while final-wire policy decoding remains trusted.
- **Breaking (library):** authorization requests are complete `Operation` enum
  variants built from `WireBudget`, `DeclaredPackets`, `ReplayFrame`, and
  `PermissiveLive`; incomplete/default requests are no longer representable.
- **Breaking (library):** `Packet::parse_with_resource_limits` became
  `parse_with_limits`, and packet documents no longer implement
  `serde::Deserialize` directly.
- Capture-file stdout encoding now spools transactionally instead of retaining
  a capture-sized encoded buffer.
- Native feature implications and the pcap-free CI profile are explicit.
  Progressive callback deadlines and native-worker cleanup now remain bounded
  without releasing state still owned by timed-out workers.

## [0.5.0-beta.2] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Added `packetcraftr tls` session assembly across TCP segmentation, with
  SNI/ALPN, negotiated parameters, JA3/JA3S/JA4, alert and completion status,
  bounded selection/buffering, text, JSON, and streaming NDJSON output.
- Added decode-only TLS records on common TCP ports, `--tls-port` overrides,
  protocol binding discovery, public TLS registry/parser/session/output APIs,
  and a runnable documentation-address capture.
- Added explicit source-spoofing policy: packet sources not owned by the
  selected interface require `--allow-source-spoofing` before discovery,
  capture, or transmission.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** TCP port dispatch can now decode TLS instead of raw payload;
  `BuiltinProtocol` and the output command vocabulary gained TLS variants.
- **Breaking:** protocol detail output exposes parent bindings, and its Rust
  constructor takes them.
- **Breaking:** passive capture requires an interface; progressive commands
  emit typed, contiguous NDJSON events ending in one completion or error.
- **Breaking:** scan output uses address-bearing endpoints; replay coordinates,
  fuzz limits, and live-only options were normalized.
- **Breaking:** the workspace became four crates: `packetcraftr-core`,
  `packetcraftr-netio`, `packetcraftr`, and `packetcraftr-cli`. Public modules
  were flattened and obsolete aliases removed.
- **Breaking:** capture rewriting preserves source format and validated records;
  `transcode` was removed and missing timestamps are diagnosed where required.
- **Breaking:** live workflows share one authorization seam, and native route
  joins the default features.
- Explicit inputs take precedence over stdin, machine output streams from exact
  bytes, live checksum rejection uses stable diagnostic codes, capture budgets
  are enforced by library policy, and public name helpers now drive text output.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** removed unused IP-fragment reassembly and its limits.
- **Breaking:** removed the always-enabled
  `decode::Options::verify_checksums` field and the fixed TLS per-direction
  buffer option.
- **Breaking:** removed unreachable packet, registry, capture-writer, document,
  decode, codec, template, client-plan, and replay convenience APIs. Use the
  remaining module-scoped entry points, including `replay::run_with_selector`.

### Fixed

- `dissect --output json --filter` always emits a complete aggregate result,
  including successful no-matches.
- Hardened structured error classification, TCP scope/reassembly, live response
  correlation and deadlines, callback/worker ownership, byte-range validation,
  resource accounting, and malformed-input handling.
- IPv4 broadcast routes remain broadcasts through selection and transmission;
  outer source routes and final destinations drive the correct checksums.
- The workspace now denies unchecked indexing and arithmetic in library code.

### Security

- Updated rtnetlink to 0.23, removing the unmaintained `paste` dependency and
  its advisory exception.

## [0.5.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Added expert finding selectors, bounded scan port ranges, incremental follow
  NDJSON, resolver-free native BPF capture filters, and exact DNS-over-UDP
  header/question dissection.
- Established deterministic nextest and cross-platform feature, MSRV, doctest,
  rustdoc, lint, and dependency-policy CI.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** consolidated the workspace into six packages split across
  packet mechanics, analysis, native networking, policy workflows, facade, and
  CLI; removed former crate aliases while preserving CLI and wire contracts.
- **Breaking:** flattened command output modules and removed unused public
  scaffolding, redundant aggregate manifests, and no-op policy flags.
- Route-only builds avoid interface-enumeration dependencies; replay uses the
  canonical dissector and fail-closed route semantics.

### Fixed

- Tightened schema validation, final-wire authorization, tunneled response
  matching, native route/interface identity, MTU selection, capture shutdown,
  PCAPNG bounds, reassembly, fuzz/live validation, DNS evidence, and replay
  sequencing.
- Live destinations are re-authorized after materialization, stale or reused
  evidence cannot satisfy probes, and queue/deadline accounting fails closed.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Published the original per-domain crate workspace, including the independent
  error/budget, packet/protocol, capture/session, analysis, native, workflow,
  output, facade, and CLI layers.
- Added `protocols` discovery and a bounded display-filter language with
  aliases, field paths, occurrence selection, slices, set/prefix membership,
  and stream indices. Filters cover read, dissect, capture, replay, and offline
  analysis.
- Added exact-round-trip VXLAN, GENEVE, LLC/SNAP, L2TPv3, ERSPAN, ESP/AH,
  PPPoE/PPP, and MPLS protocol support with strict discriminator and tunnel
  boundary handling.
- Added offline `follow`, `expert`, and `stats` commands on a shared bounded
  read/dissect/index/filter pipeline with capture-global conversation indices.
- Added replay selection before authorization/transmission while retaining
  stream budgets and source timing.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** offline analysis moved to `packetcraftr-analysis` and
  `packetcraftr::analysis`, with no dependency on live I/O.
- **Breaking:** `BoundaryError` became canonical in the error domain, and
  Ethernet/VLAN discriminator values at or below 1500 now decode as 802.3/LLC
  payload lengths.
- Native features moved to the networking crate, interface enumeration became
  `native-interfaces`, and the output-v1 vocabulary gained protocol discovery.
- Repository layout and documentation were aligned with Cargo metadata and
  generated CLI help as authoritative sources.

### Removed

- Removed the unreleased `cli` feature; build the `packetcraftr-cli` package.
- Removed the redundant exchange `Io` marker; use the sender and capture
  provider traits directly.

## [0.4.0-beta.2] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Added first-run, contributor, security, issue, review, and CODEOWNERS
  guidance; terminal-aware human color; command-focused CLI examples; and
  Linux native E2E/CI coverage.
- Added exact GRE, SCTP, IGMP, and nested IPv4/IPv6 construction/dissection,
  plus SCTP and quoted-ICMP exchange correlation.

### Changed

- Release archives include the README and changelog, CLI diagnostics share one
  hardened renderer, and route/materialization logic follows only the outer IP
  envelope.
- Protocol numbers for IGMP, nested IP, GRE, and SCTP became typed bindings.
  Packet building, scan/traceroute batching, and binding lookup allocate less.

### Fixed

- Hardened strict packet semantics across routing, authorization, checksums,
  replay, correlation, workflow budgets, capture I/O, TCP reassembly, native
  interface identity, macOS routes, Linux netlink, and CLI exit handling.
- Fixed PPPoE continuation, timestamp minima, Ethernet/VLAN raw fallback,
  packet-schema validation, capture-worker cleanup, and failure-atomic writing.

### Security

- Documented and time-bounded the temporary `RUSTSEC-2024-0436` exception and
  enabled weekly dependency updates.

## [0.4.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Added tag-driven multi-platform full and pcap-free release archives with
  SHA-256 checksums.
- Added named `ReaderOptions`, `PcapOptions`, and `PcapNgOptions`.

### Changed

- Reduced build/decode and reassembly allocations, reused route decisions, and
  simplified capture construction and workflow extension traits.
- Clarified traceroute identity, timeout, rate, policy, and output behavior.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** removed `Reader::read_frame` / `Writer::write`; use
  `next_frame` / `write_frame`.
- **Breaking:** removed legacy clock, reassembly, fragment-key, resolved-target,
  capture-constructor, output link-type, DNS transport, workflow error/stats,
  and route identifier aliases. Their module-scoped replacements are canonical.

### Fixed

- Corrected schema API documentation; preserved traceroute identity and fresh
  ICMP correlation; enforced capture section bounds, replay link-type checks,
  and consistent binding priority.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- **Breaking:** reorganized the Rust API under canonical capture, client, error,
  net, output, packet, protocol, session, and workflow domains.
- Consolidated the workspace into one Rust 2024 package while preserving Rust
  1.96, feature profiles, CLI commands, packet documents, and output contracts.

### Fixed

- Hardened packet/dissection, tunneled responses, workflow evidence, capture
  deadlines, neighbor caching, reassembly, PCAP/PCAPNG handling, CLI parsing,
  native routes, feature gates, and interface validation.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Established the original PacketcraftR packet, capture, native networking,
  session, workflow, library, and CLI baseline.
