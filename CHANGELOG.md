# Changelog

All notable changes to PacketcraftR are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added an explicit default-enabled `cli` feature so library-only builds can
  omit Clap and terminal-rendering dependencies.
- Added offline `packetcraftr protocols [PROTOCOL]` discovery with stable
  built-in capability listings, case-insensitive alias lookup, reflective field
  details, and text or aggregate JSON output.
- Added validated owned protocol, field, provider, package, component,
  extension, digest, and catalog identities; immutable schemas with explicit
  field IDs, bounded constraints, and deterministic hashes; and host-owned
  `DynamicLayer` values across build, decode, document, expression, template,
  output, and fuzz paths.
- Added runtime-neutral protocol providers and per-operation sessions.
  Immutable provenance-aware catalog snapshots lazily create one session per
  provider, retain selected root/binding/fallback origins, and produce
  insertion-order-independent catalog hashes.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Restructured PacketcraftR as a Cargo workspace. The root
  `packetcraftr` package is now a façade whose library re-exports the public
  domains from thirteen member crates under `crates/` and whose binary is a thin
  launcher into `packetcraftr-cli`; no domain implementation remains in the root
  package. Member crates are `packetcraftr-model`, `-capture`, `-packet`,
  `-protocols`, `-session`, `-net`, `-net-native`, `-policy`, `-client`,
  `-workflow`, `-workflow-client`, `-output`, and `-cli`. The dependency graph is
  acyclic, no member depends on the root package, native platform code and
  target-specific dependencies are confined to `packetcraftr-net-native`, and the
  traffic-authorization boundary is confined to `packetcraftr-policy`. Package
  metadata, dependency versions, lints, and the checked release arithmetic
  profile are declared once at the workspace level. The `packetcraftr` binary
  name, the `cli`/`native-interfaces`/`native-route`/`native-layer2`/
  `native-layer3` features, default-feature behaviour, CLI output, schemas,
  goldens, and published examples are unchanged.
- **BREAKING**: Moved traffic policy and live target resolution out of `client`.
  `packetcraftr::client::policy` is now `packetcraftr::policy`, and
  `packetcraftr::client::target` is now `packetcraftr::policy::target`.
- **BREAKING**: Moved `Frame`, `LinkType`, `Direction`, and `ProtocolId` into the
  shared model. Frame constructors and `Frame::validate` now return the dedicated
  `FrameError` instead of a PCAP parser error, and `capture::Error` reports those
  three length invariants through a transparent `Error::Frame` variant with
  unchanged messages and classification.
- **BREAKING**: `FieldKind`, `FieldValue`, and `workflow::replay::Timing` are no
  longer `#[non_exhaustive]`, so first-party mapping layers in sibling crates
  keep translating them exhaustively.
- **BREAKING**: Replaced the mutable, priority-based packet protocol registry
  with `ProtocolRegistrationSet`, `ProtocolCatalogBuilder`,
  `ProtocolCatalogPolicy`, `ProtocolCatalogSnapshot`, and
  `ProtocolCatalogOperation`. Trusted Rust implementations now register
  `NativeLayerCodec` and `NativeResponseMatcher` values through
  `NativeProtocolModule` and `NativeProtocolProvider`; codecs receive
  host-resolved child and parent-local binding facts rather than the complete
  catalog. Exact conflicts require host origin selection, built-ins remain the
  default, decode-only bindings never create reverse encoding choices, and a
  provider session is never shared across packet operations.
- Promoted the seams that out-of-crate workflow executors need to public API:
  `Client::exchange_for_workflow`, `workflow::scan::classify_response`,
  `workflow::traceroute::classify_response`, `workflow::dns::correlates`,
  `Stats::checked_add`, and `Layer::declared_layout_fields`.
- Renamed the canonical interface-enumeration feature to
  `native-interfaces`; native route, Layer 2, and Layer 3 capabilities now
  enable it explicitly.
- Extended the pre-1.0 public output API and `packetcraftr.output/v1` command
  vocabulary with the additive `protocols` aggregate result contracts.

### Removed

- Removed the redundant `net::exchange::Io` marker trait; generic code can use
  the public `net::transmit::Sender + net::capture::Provider` bounds directly.
- Removed `ProtocolRegistry`, `RegistryBuilder`, `RegistryError`,
  `ProtocolModule`, `LayerCodec`, `ResponseMatcher`, numeric binding priorities,
  codec-owned alias metadata, and the borrowed static schema contract without
  compatibility re-exports.

## [0.4.0-beta.2] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Added first-run documentation covering verified feature combinations,
  platform prerequisites, live-traffic safety gates, privileges, examples, and
  troubleshooting.
- Added contributor and security guidance, reproducible bug and
  native-networking issue forms, a pull-request impact and test checklist,
  area/type labeling guidance, and CODEOWNERS routing for safety-sensitive and
  serialized-contract changes.
- Added terminal-aware coloured human output with explicit `--color <WHEN>`
  control (`auto`, `always`, or `never`); structured, hexadecimal, raw, and
  capture-file outputs remain free of terminal styling.
- Added command-focused help examples and clearer output-format, input, and
  safety guidance across the CLI.
- Added exact packet construction and dissection for GRE, SCTP common headers
  with validated opaque chunks, and IGMP, plus IPv4/IPv6-in-IP encapsulation.
- Added SCTP INIT/INIT-ACK and quoted-ICMP response correlation for generic
  exchanges.
- Added a strict Linux-native E2E harness with isolated client, router, and
  server namespaces, independent IPv4/IPv6 UDP and TCP fixtures, deterministic
  teardown, and failure-time network diagnostics.
- Added deterministic native smoke coverage for IPv4/IPv6 route planning and
  Layer 3 transmission, plus successful, timed-out, and unsolicited UDP
  exchanges validated by independent socket fixtures and the output-v1 schema.
- Added an explicit CI baseline and a reusable privileged Linux native-E2E
  workflow with failure evidence.

### Changed

- Release binary archives now include `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` alongside
  the executable and license.
- CLI help, version, and parse diagnostics now use one hardened document
  renderer with terminal-control escaping and semantic styling.
- Route planning and live materialization now use only the outer IP envelope;
  encapsulated addresses remain independent and drive inner transport checksums.
- IP protocol numbers 2, 4, 41, 47, and 132 are now typed bindings, so strict
  builds require IGMP, nested IP, GRE, or SCTP children instead of raw payloads.
- Improved scan and traceroute workflow scaling for large probe batches while
  preserving endpoint, response-evidence, and diagnostic ordering.
- Reduced deep packet-builder allocations and repeated binding work by
  collecting materialized layers, layouts, and encoded payload lengths directly
  while codecs retain an immutable view of the source packet.

### Fixed

- Native E2E command timeouts and interruptions now terminate the complete
  privileged process group, treat zombie descendants as exited during survival
  checks, and drain remaining namespace PIDs before teardown.
- Fixed `packetcraftr.output/v1` schema validation for embedded packet fields so
  malformed field values are rejected consistently with standalone packet
  documents.
- Active exchanges now require monotonic capture ingress timing, reject stale or
  unmarked frames during correlation, bound correlation CPU work, and shut down
  capture providers exactly once even when cleanup fails or panics.
- Live routing, destination authorization, checksums, replay, and response
  matching now share strict packet semantics, including ARP targets, IPv4 source
  routes, IPv6 segment routing, transport ports, and unknown route-bearing layers.
- Workflow and replay duration, packet, and byte budgets now cover actual
  provider and callback time, cumulative replay traffic, and fail-atomic
  accounting before later side effects begin.
- Capture-file writers now stop after partial I/O failures, capture readers use
  fallible bounded allocation, and native capture queue statistics update
  transactionally.
- TCP reassembly now applies segment limits to final retained state and prevents
  older accepted segment timestamps from moving flow expiry backwards.
- Native I/O now revalidates interface name/index identity immediately before
  dispatch (subject to OS changes between validation and the send syscall),
  bounds complete macOS route queries, propagates capture-worker panics, and
  reuses namespace-aware Linux netlink workers without nesting runtimes.
- Preserved readable multiline Clap diagnostics instead of displaying escaped
  newline literals, and now propagate Clap's actual exit codes.

### Security

- Documented the verified `RUSTSEC-2024-0436` transitive dependency path and
  rejected upgrade candidates, retained the existing exception expiry, added
  an enforced 2026-09-15 remediation target, and enabled weekly Cargo
  dependency update pull requests.

## [0.4.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Added tag-driven GitHub Releases with full and pcap-free binary archives for
  Linux x86-64, macOS x86-64 and Arm64, and Windows x86-64, plus SHA-256
  checksums for every release asset.
- Added `ReaderOptions`, `PcapOptions`, and `PcapNgOptions` for named offline
  capture resource and format configuration.

### Changed

- Reduced packet build and decode allocations by composing checksums across
  byte slices and preserving decoder fallback bytes without copying them.
- Reused passive route decisions within one exchange, stopped preparation from
  starting additional work after its deadline, and localized TCP and fragment
  reassembly updates to the affected pending ranges.
- Made packet assembly grow amortized-contiguously and patched resolved MAC
  addresses directly into built-in Ethernet frames while retaining full rebuilds
  for external codecs.
- Kept bounded TCP retransmission history in a ring buffer so long-lived streams
  no longer copy the retained history for every small in-order segment.
- Clarified traceroute probe identity, timeout, rate, policy, and output-format
  behavior in CLI help.
- Simplified offline capture construction to one default and one options path
  per format, and consolidated PCAPNG interface configuration around the full
  `Interface` description. Existing capture bytes and validation behavior are
  preserved.
- Simplified workflow extension traits to use `workflow::BoundaryError` and
  `workflow::Stats` directly. DNS remains UDP-only and output-v1 continues to
  emit the required `"transport": "udp"` field.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** Removed the forwarding `Reader::read_frame` and `Writer::write`
  methods; use `next_frame` and `write_frame` respectively.
- **Breaking:** Removed the legacy `workflow::clock::System`, `session::Limits`,
  `session::fragment::Key`, and Boolean `ResolvedTarget::address_for_family`
  names; use `SystemClock`, `ReassemblyLimits`, `DatagramKey`, and
  `address_for_version(IpVersion)`.
- **Breaking:** Removed positional offline capture constructor permutations.
  Use `Reader::with_options`, `Writer::pcap_with_options`,
  `Writer::pcapng_with_options`, and `Writer::add_interface_description`.
- **Breaking:** Removed `output::network::plan::LinkType`; route output decisions
  now expose their unchanged serialized numeric link type as `u32`.
- **Breaking:** Removed the fixed `workflow::dns::Transport` and the transport
  field from `workflow::dns::Result`; the executable workflow remains UDP-only.
- **Breaking:** Removed workflow-local authorization/execution error aliases and
  `workflow::fuzz::ExecutionStats`; use `workflow::BoundaryError` and
  `workflow::Stats`.
- **Breaking:** Removed `net::route::Id`; use `net::interface::Id`. Removed
  `net::route::{Capability, Mode, MacAddress}`; use the corresponding
  `net::link` names.
- **Breaking:** Removed the resolved-address limit constants from
  `client::target`; use `client::policy::{DEFAULT_MAX_RESOLVED_ADDRESSES,
  MAX_RESOLVED_ADDRESSES}`.

### Fixed

- Corrected the packet schema documentation to reference the canonical
  `packet::field::Value` Rust path.
- Preserved per-hop network-layer identity across multi-attempt traceroutes,
  matched quoted ICMP errors with monotonic capture timing, rejected zero
  traceroute ports, and reused live client state across hops.
- Enforced finite PCAPNG section boundaries, rejected raw IPv4/IPv6 replay when
  the capture link type disagrees with the packet version, and made protocol
  binding priority winners consistent for both decoding and packet building.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Reorganized the Rust library API under the canonical `capture`,
  `client`, `error`, `net`, `output`, `packet`, `protocol`, `session`, and
  `workflow` domains, replacing the broad top-level facade re-exports and the
  library-owned CLI entry point.
- Consolidated the multi-crate workspace into one Rust 2024 package while
  retaining Rust 1.96 as the minimum supported version and preserving the
  portable, default, and complete feature profiles.
- Preserved the CLI command set and versioned packet and output contracts while
  consolidating command execution, validation, error mapping, and rendering.

### Fixed

- Hardened packet construction and dissection, tunneled response matching,
  workflow evidence validation, capture deadlines, neighbor caching, and TCP
  reassembly so malformed or inconsistent inputs fail closed.
- Improved classic PCAP and PCAPNG validation, interoperability, timestamp
  handling, and failure atomicity, including compatible PCAPNG 1.2 sections.
- Prevented structured CLI parse errors from panicking on non-UTF-8 Unix
  arguments and stopped command inference at the `--` end-of-options marker.
- Tightened native route and capture feature gating, Windows adapter parsing,
  numeric interface validation, and portable interface enumeration.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Established the original PacketcraftR packet, capture, native networking,
  session, workflow, library, and CLI baseline.
